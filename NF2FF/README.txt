Description
-----------
PySNF (which stands for Python Spherical Near-Field) is an open source 
spherical near-field to far-field module written in Python. With PySNF, 
users can calculate spherical wave coefficients from simulated or measured 
antenna radiation patterns. In addition, PySNF supports probe-corrected 
spherical near-field to far-field transforms. The majority of the code in 
this module was developed using equations presented in the book Spherical 
Near-Field Antenna Measurements, edited by J.E. Hansen.
